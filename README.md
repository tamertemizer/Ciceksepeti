The competition problem was this. There are shop coordinates given in bayiler.csv and flower orders given in siparisler.csv. There are minimum and maximum quotas for each shop. We were asked to implement an algorithm that assigned the orders to a specific shop according to their quotas. The route needed to be as short as possible. So this is like a multi garage traveling salesman problem. 

To start the program you need to run the NearestNeighbour.java. This creates an output.json file. Then you can view this file through index.html. Index.html might have some CORS problems in Chrome due to security reasons, if it happens you can view it with Microsoft Edge or Internet Explorer.

Also there are pre-created output.json files that you can use to view immediately. The smaller the value the better the path is. Rename the pre-created output-x.json files to output.json to view them.
